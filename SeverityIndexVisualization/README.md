# SeverityIndexVisualization - Visualizations of the Severity Index

A Mathematica Notebook containing code used for the visualizations of the COVID severity index found in Appendix B. 

This notebook contains commands to import the data generated by `RawDataToUsableDataConverter`, plot the time-series data (cumulative cases per capita) for any list of counties (along with their associated severity index), and plot the distribution of all COVID severity indices.

By running the entire notebook, the user may recreate the severity index visualizations found in Appendix B.
