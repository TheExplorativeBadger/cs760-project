# DecisionTreeRegression - A Binary Decision Tree with Linear Regression

A Mathematica Notebook containing an implementation of a binary decision tree with linear regression to predict COVID severity indices for counties in the United States.

This notebook contains commands to import the data generated by `RawDataToUsableDataConverter`, binarize the data, calculating the mutual information between two samples, training the decision tree, evaluating samples, and performing a `K`-fold cross validation (with samples in a randomized order). By running the entire notbook, the user may recreate the accuracy testing results for this method, and the visualization of the first four layers of the decision tree.
