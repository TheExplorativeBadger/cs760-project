# Neural Network

Requires Python 3 to run, as well as the Numpy, Tensorflow, and Sklearn modules. 

To Run:
1. Create a FinalCombinedFeaturesWithSeverity.csv file using cs760-project/RawDataToUsableDataConverter.

2. Run NeuralNetwork.py. Training results will be printed to console.

3. (Optional) Adjust the tunable parameters within the Parameters section of NeuralNetwork.py to improve training results.
